## 🚀 Setup and Installation

Before running any Python scripts in this project, please follow these steps to create a virtual environment and install the required packages.

### 1. Create a virtual environment

Run this command in the project root folder to create a `.venv` folder (you can name it differently if you want):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
````

### 2. Activate the virtual environment

* On Linux/macOS:

  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

* On Windows (PowerShell):

  ```powershell
  .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```

* On Windows (CMD):

  ```cmd
  .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
  ```

### 3. Install required packages

Once the virtual environment is activated, install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Deactivate when done (optional)

To exit the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```
